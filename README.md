# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


# How do I run this project?

Click on index.html to begin, once all of the files are downloaded. Check out the bottom of the page, where it will show the status of the tests.

# Where are the tests created?

For information on the tests itself, check out feedreader.js

# Why so many files?

The files were created to help differentiate the different components of the project.
feedreader.js is the main file that I worked on, which was creating the tests.
